            Design, for me, is simply giving life to the many <br />
            ideas constantly buzzing in my head. I love to <br />
            draw, play with colors, and explore the endless <br />
            possibilities that come from starting with a blank <br />
            canvas.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m a multidisciplinary designer, and I’ve been on this roller <br />
            coaster for about 6 years now. My style has always been “Well, I <br />
            think I can, so let’s try,” and that mindset has helped me pick up <br />
            skills across different design niches. <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, I’ve had the chance to bring brands to life,
            <br />
            collaborate with national organizations both locally and
            <br />
            internationally, and just enjoy the process of creating.
